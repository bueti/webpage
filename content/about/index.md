I like mountains, photography, and travelling. For a living I am doing "computer things". I am in the sphere between software development and operations  and currently work as a tech-lead at [Ricardo](https://www.ricardo.ch).

The interactions between teams and departments in work environments fascinate me. The book ["The Phoenix Project"]({{< ref "phoenix_project" >}}) opened my eyes and had a tremendous impact on me and my career. Check out my LinkedIn page for more details.

If you like travelling you should check out my [travel blog](https://www.granviaje.ch) about the three years on the road with my wife and our dog in North and South America.
