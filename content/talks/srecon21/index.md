SREcon 21 was my second SREcon after 2016 and the first conference where I had a talk. Unfortunately, the talk was prerecorded but that also made it easier, nevertheless once they pressed play and I heard myself talking I was just as nervous!

> When the SRE Book was published in 2016 the job title of SRE was not widely used outside Google. Fast-forward five years and it seems like every company is hiring SREs. Did the System Administrator and Operations jobs disappear or have their job titles simply changed?
